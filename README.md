# Car Selling App

This project came about very spontaneously, i got bored making "fake" databases, so i consider to learn database, I choosed AppWrite (its easy and i heard about it on youtube), make everything solo in here (mostly, chatgpt helped me with a idea of merging two queries by pushing them conditionally to array[]), back to topic - I learn quite a lot staff in this quick project (from 2am to 5am ‚ò†Ô∏è). At morning (for now it will be 1-2pm, I want to build a UI/UX design to it, becouse I made mostly functionalities.) I will use shadcn components and color pallete.

# WHATS INSIDE?

- Its website of "car selling shop", gets from database cars and show them (soon: more functions), and filtering system to it,
- Working on UI/UX and some more addons to it, so it could be nice for user.

- For now (19.08.2025 - 5am) its alfa version of website it has only basic functionalities,
there are screens how it look like fn.
